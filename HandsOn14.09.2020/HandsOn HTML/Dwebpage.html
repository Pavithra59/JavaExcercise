<p>Cacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, 
according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods,
which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. 
<b>The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, 
where they are left for two to seven days.</b> Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma.
It also destroys the seed's embryo, preventing unwanted germination,
 and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.</p><br><br><br>

<p style="background-color:beige;" align="center">Chocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, 
 a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. 
 A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, 
 found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of 
 developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.</p>
